## What is GIT & GitHub

**What is GIT?**

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

**What is Distributed Version Control?**

Distributed version control systems (DVCS) use a peer-to-peer approach to version control, as opposed to the clientâ€“server approach of centralized systems. Distributed revision control synchronizes repositories by transferring patches from peer to peer. There is no single central version of the codebase; instead, each user has a working copy and the full change history.

Put simply, each person in a team has a copy of the project, they edit their copy of the project and update a local database with the reason for their edits all of this initially being stored locally on their computer. These are all then pushed up to a shared version, which is where GitHub comes in.

**What is GitHub?**

Beings that you are using GitHub to read this I imagine you already have a vague idea of what GitHub is, but for the sake of being thorough.

This is a place for to store and share the centralised version of the project. The benefits of GitHub is that one can issue commands from a command line shell. I shall undate this document further to have mnore information, though for now I feel this is enough.

## Install GIT

Realtively straightforward just go to the command line and type.

```
$ sudo apt install git-all
```

## Create a GitHub Account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/join) and sign up.

## Create a local GIT repository

This is where is gets slightly more complex for a beginner though still realtively straitforward.

One will neede to make a project directory in one's home directory.                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
$ mkdir Projects                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Enter this directory                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
$ cd Projects
```

Then create a directory for you specific project, we shall call this one LFS-Suckless

```
$ mkdir LFS-Suckless
```

We now need to initialise GIT in this specific  project directory enter the directory and intitalise GIT.

``` 
$ cd LFS-Suckless
$ git init
```

Next we create a README.md in markdown using Neo-Vim and then look at how to update GIT and create a repository on GitHub.
