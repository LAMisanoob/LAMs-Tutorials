# Linux/Unix A Brief History

1960s-1970s; Kenneth Thompson, and Dennis Ritchie, develop the Unix operating system in assembly language. Ritchie develops the C programming language from Thompson's B. Unix rewritten in C, first OS able to run on any hardware.

1980s-1990s; POSIX forms, attempting to standardise OSs. Richard Stallman forms Free Software Foundation, attempting to create a free Unix; 'free' meaning freely used, read, modified, and redistributed. FSF develop many GNU tools; C compiler (gcc), Text Editor (emacs), Bourne-again Shell (Bash); though has difficulties developing an OS kernel. Linus Torvalds develops an OS kernel; Linux. Linux combined with FSF/GNU components, BSD components, and MIT’s X-windows give birth to a free Unix. Components are put together in different combinations; combinations are called 'distributions', such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian; though they all have the same foundation, the Linux kernel and GNU glibc libraries, which have “copyleft” licenses, a unifying force between Linux distributions that does not exist between BSD and AT&T-derived Unix systems.
