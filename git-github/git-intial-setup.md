## What is GIT & GitHub

**What is GIT?**

Open source distributed version control system.

**What is Distributed Version Control?**

Peer-to-peer approach to version control, as opposed to the clientâ€“server approach of centralized systems. Distributed revision control synchronizes repositories by transferring patches from peer to peer. No single central version of the codebase; each user has a working copy and the full change history.

Put simply, each person in a team has a copy of the project, edit their copy of the project and update a local database detailing a reason for their edits, this all being stored locally on their computer. Then pushed chanegs to a shared version, which is where GitHub comes in.

**What is GitHub?**

You are using GitHub to read this so you have a vague idea of what GitHub is, but for the sake of being thorough.

A place for to store and share the centralised version of the project. One can issue commands from the command line to perform most tasks.

## Install GIT

In ubuntu type `$ sudo apt install git-all` at the command line.

## Create a GitHub Account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/join) and sign up.

## Create a local GIT repository

Type the following at the command line.


`$ mkdir Projects` Make directory in home directory.

`$ cd Projects` Move to this directory.

`$ mkdir git-intial-setup` Make directory for your specific project, this one is called git-intial-setup.

Enter the directory for the specific project, and intitalise GIT.

``` 
$ cd LFS-Suckless
$ git init
```

Next we create a README.md in markdown using Neo-Vim and then look at how to update GIT and create a repository on GitHub.
