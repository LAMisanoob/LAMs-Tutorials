## What is GIT & GitHub

**What is GIT?**

Open source distributed version control system.

**What is Distributed Version Control?**

Peer-to-peer approach to version control, as opposed to the clientâ€“server approach of centralized systems. Distributed revision control synchronizes repositories by transferring patches from peer to peer. No single central version of the codebase; each user has a working copy and the full change history.

Put simply, each person in a team has a copy of the project, edit their copy of the project and update a local database detailing a reason for their edits, this all being stored locally on their computer. Then pushed chanegs to a shared version, which is where GitHub comes in.

**What is GitHub?**

You are using GitHub to read this so you have a vague idea of what GitHub is, but for the sake of being thorough.

A place for to store and share the centralised version of the project. One can issue commands from the command line to perform most tasks.

## Install GIT

In ubuntu type `$ sudo apt install git-all` at the command line.

## Create a GitHub Account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/join) and sign up.

## Create a local GIT repository

Type the following at the command line.

Make a directory `$ mkdir project` Move to this directory `$ cd project` Intitalise GIT `$ git init`

## Add a file to the repository

Create a README.md using Neo-Vim `$ nvim README.md` Write a description of your project, I would recommend learning markdown.

Once you have saved the file check the status of git repo using `$ git status` See what changed have been made and not yet added or commited.

Add the file to the repo `$ git add README.md`

Commit the changes and leave a comment `$ git commit -m "your comment goes here"`



and then look at how to update GIT and create a repository on GitHub.
