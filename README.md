# LAMS-TUTORIALS

Tutorials/cheatsheets to refresh my memory while learning about Linux/GNU, and programming. 

Subjects listed, importance explained, hyperlink to full tutorial.

## VIRTUAL BOX
Virtualisation; create a virtual computer, on a computer, using software. 

Benefits:
- Won't f your computer if you screw something up.
- Standardisation of "hardware"; if working in team.
- Snapshots of current state; reverse mistakes.

## UNIX/LINUX

**1960s-1970s;** Kenneth Thompson, and Dennis Ritchie, develop the Unix operating system in assembly language. Ritchie develops the C programming language from Thompson's B. Unix rewritten in C, first OS able to run on any hardware.    

**1980s-1990s;** POSIX forms, attempting to standardise OSs. Richard Stallman forms Free Software Foundation, attempting to create a free Unix; 'free' meaning freely used, read, modified, and redistributed. FSF develop many GNU tools; C compiler (gcc), Text Editor (emacs), Bourne-again Shell (Bash); though has difficulties developing an OS kernel. Linus Torvalds develops an OS kernel; Linux. Linux combined with FSF/GNU components, BSD components, and MIT’s X-windows give birth to a free Unix. Components are put together in different combinations; combinations are called 'distributions', such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian; though they all have the same foundation, the Linux kernel and GNU glibc libraries, which have “copyleft” licenses, a unifying force between Linux distributions that does not exist between BSD and AT&T-derived Unix systems.

Interesting advocacy piece arguing for using Unix (instead of Microsoft) is John Kirch’s paper “Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 versus UNIX”.



the fact so many things run on it, and this trend seems to be increasing.

The benefits, and importance, of open source.
