# LAMS-TUTORIALS

Tutorials/cheatsheets to refresh my memory while learning about Linux/GNU, and programming. 

Subjects listed, importance explained, hyperlink to full tutorial.

## VIRTUAL BOX
Vitualisation; create a virtual computer, on a computer, using software. 

Many benefits:
- Don't f up your computer if you screw something up.
- Standardisation of "hardware" if working in a team.
- Snapshots of current state, mistake can be reversable.

## UNIX/LINUX
Unix history, Linux History

Late  1960s; Kenneth Thompson, and Dennis Ritchie, develop Unix.   
Early 1970s; Unix rewritten in C programming language, is one of the first operating systems that could run on any hardware.   
Late  1970s; the “seventh edition” (V7) version of Unix was released, the grandfather of all extant Unix systems.  
Late  1980s; "War” raged. Academia, led by Berkeley, developed the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), AT&T developed Unix under the names “System III” and later “System V”.   

Each adopted features of the other. AT&T won the “standards war”. Hardware vendors switched to AT&T. However, System V incorporated many BSD innovations, so more of a merger. BSD did not die, widely used for research, PC hardware, and single-purpose servers. The result was many versions of Unix, based on the seventh edition. Most were proprietary, maitnained by hardware vendors, three versions ended up as open source: FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

A slightly old but interesting advocacy piece that presents arguments for using Unix-like systems (instead of Microsoft’s products) is John Kirch’s paper “Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 versus UNIX”.



the fact so many things run on it, and this trend seems to be increasing.

The benefits, and importance, of open source.
