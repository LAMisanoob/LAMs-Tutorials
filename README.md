# LAMS-TUTORIALS

Tutorials/cheatsheets to refresh my memory while learning about Linux/GNU, and programming. 

Subjects listed, importance explained, hyperlink to full tutorial.

## VIRTUAL BOX
Vitualisation; create a virtual computer, on a computer, using software. 

Many benefits:
- Won't f your computer if you screw something up.
- Standardisation of "hardware"; if working in team.
- Snapshots of current state; reverse mistakes.

## UNIX/LINUX

**1960s-1970s;** Kenneth Thompson, and Dennis Ritchie, develop the Unix operating system in assembly language. Ritchie develops the C programming language from Thompson's B. Unix rewritten in C, first OS able to run on any hardware.     
**1980s-1990s;** "War” between Berkeley and AT&T. AT&T wins, though assimilated much of Berkley's Unix, so more of a merger. POSIX forms, attempting to standardise operating systems. Richard Stallman forms FSF/GNU, attempts to create a free Unix; 'free' meaning it could be freely used, read, modified, and redistributed. Stallman develops many useful tools such as a C compiler (gcc), and a Text Editor (emacs), though had difficulties developing an OS kernel. Linus Torvalds develops an OS kernel; Linux. Linux combined with FSF/GNU components and others; BSD components, and MIT’s X-windows; produce a free Unix. Components are put together in different combinations, each combination called a 'distribution'. Common distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. There are differences, but all have the same foundation; the Linux kernel and GNU glibc libraries, both having “copyleft” style licenses; meaning changes generally must be made available to all, a unifying force between the Linux distributions that does not exist between the BSD and AT&T-derived Unix systems.

Unix history, Linux History

Old yet interesting advocacy piece arguing for using Unix (instead of Microsoft) is John Kirch’s paper “Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 versus UNIX”.



the fact so many things run on it, and this trend seems to be increasing.

The benefits, and importance, of open source.
