VIRTUAL BOX:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
##### Creating a virtual computer on your computer
###### Benefits: Standardisation of "hardware"; if working in a team. Snapshots of current state; can reverse mistakes. Run Linux on any OS; tutorial are on Linux and its tools. Won't bork your main driver if you screw something up.

Highly recommend learning to use a virtual machine (VM) as the first thing to learn. When first learning Linux I regularly reinstalled directly onto my machine, due to wanting to try different distros, or wanting a fresh install. A VM speeds up the process, and never leaves you without a machine to work on. I quickly learnt from my mistakes.

## GNU/LINUX

Unix-like OS, with an awesome history. Free software philosophy; not as in cost, but as in freedom of choice, opensource. An ever increasing amount of things run on Linux; supercomputers, servers and therefore the internet, smartphones (android), personal computers (many use Linux, and OSx is a varient of BSD, a proprietary version of Unix).

Linux can be broken down into many parts.

Bootloader; Initialises hardware and starts Kernal.
Kernal; Interacts with hardware, does memory management, task scheduling, file management, etc.

Shell; A way to interact with your computer using a text interface. Interprets commands
