# LAMS-TUTORIALS

Tutorials/cheatsheets to refresh my memory while learning about Linux/GNU, and programming. 

Subjects listed in an order that I feel it is worth learning them in, importance of each explained, hyperlink to full tutorial.

## VIRTUAL BOX
Virtualisation; create a virtual computer, on a computer, using software. 

I would highly recommend using a virtual machine when learning new things. When I first crossed over to Linux I was reinstalling directly onto the machine reguarly to try different distros, and also because I wanted a fresh install that I hadn't yet messed with. Doing it this way speeds up the process, and never leaves you without a machine to work on. I quickly learnt from my mistakes.

Benefits:
- Won't f your main driver if you screw something up.
- Standardisation of "hardware"; if working in a team.
- Snapshots of current state; can reverse mistakes.
- Run Linux on any OS; tutorial are on Linux and its tools.

## GNU/LINUX

Unix-like OS, with an awesome history. Free software philosophy; not as in cost, but as in freedom of choice, opensource. An ever increasing amount of things run on Linux; supercomputers, servers and therefore the internet, smartphones (android), personal computers (many use Linux, and OSx is a varient of BSD, a proprietary version of Unix).

Linux can be broken down into many parts.

Bootloader; Initialises hardware and starts Kernal.
Kernal; Interacts with hardware, does memory management, task scheduling, file management, etc.

Shell; A way to interact with your computer using a text interface. Interprets commands
