VIRTUAL BOX
===========
**Create a virtual computer on your computer**
> Working in a virtual machine (VM) is top priority. When first learning Linux I regularly reinstalled directly onto my machine; wanted to try different distros, or to have a fresh install. VMs speed up the process, never leaving you without a working machine. I quickly learnt from my mistakes.
###### Benefits: Standardisation of "hardware"; if working in a team. Snapshots of current state; can reverse mistakes. Run Linux on any OS; tutorial are on Linux and its tools. Won't bork your main driver if you screw something up.

## GNU/LINUX

Unix-like OS, with an awesome history. Free software philosophy; not as in cost, but as in freedom of choice, opensource. An ever increasing amount of things run on Linux; supercomputers, servers and therefore the internet, smartphones (android), personal computers (many use Linux, and OSx is a varient of BSD, a proprietary version of Unix).

Linux can be broken down into many parts.

Bootloader; Initialises hardware and starts Kernal.
Kernal; Interacts with hardware, does memory management, task scheduling, file management, etc.

Shell; A way to interact with your computer using a text interface. Interprets commands
