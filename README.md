Many benefits:

## UNIX/LINUX

1960s; Kenneth Thompson, and Dennis Ritchie, develop Unix.   
1970s; Rewritten in C, Unix is one of the first operating systems able to run on any hardware.   
1970s; V7 Unix was released, the grandfather of all extant Unix systems.  
1980s; "War” raged. Berkeley, and AT&T contiued to develop Unix. Hardware vendors switched to AT&T. AT&T won the "war", however, System V incorporated many BSD innovations, so more of a merger. Though BSD did not die.
The result was many versions of Unix. Most proprietary, though three open source versions remained: FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
