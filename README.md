Subjects listed, importance explained, hyperlink to full tutorial.

## VIRTUAL BOX
Vitualisation; create a virtual computer, on a computer, using software. 

Many benefits:
- Don't f up your computer if you screw something up.
- Standardisation of "hardware" if working in a team.
- Snapshots of current state, mistake can be reversable.

## UNIX/LINUX
Unix history, Linux History

Late  1960s; Kenneth Thompson, and Dennis Ritchie, develop Unix.   
Early 1970s; Rewritten in C, Unix is one of the first operating systems able to run on any hardware.   
Late  1970s; V7 Unix was released, the grandfather of all extant Unix systems.  
Late  1980s; "War” raged. Berkeley, and AT&T contiued to develop Unix. Hardware vendors switched to AT&T. AT&T won the "war", however, System V incorporated many BSD innovations, so more of a merger. Though BSD did not die.
The result was many versions of Unix. Most proprietary, though three open source versions remained: FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

Old yet interesting advocacy piece arguing for using Unix (instead of Microsoft) is John Kirch’s paper “Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 versus UNIX”.



the fact so many things run on it, and this trend seems to be increasing.

The benefits, and importance, of open source.
